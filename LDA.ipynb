      "\n",
      "To your problem\n",
      "I think you're running into a native reflection issue. Native GraalVM cannot understand private reflections. A good intro to native images ca be found here (Note sections limitations point 2: Reflection):\n",
      "https://www.baeldung.com/spring-native-intro\n",
      "To understand and fix your particular problem you find more precise infors in the GraalVM docs:\n",
      "https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/current/reference/html/native-image.html#native-image.introducing-graalvm-native-images.understanding-aot-processing\n",
      "You'll need Reflection hints configured in (reflect-config.json) as decribed in the doc. It also might be good enough to disable aot (ahead of time compilation)\n",
      "$ java -Dspring.aot.enabled=true -jar myapplication.jar\n",
      "Why does IntelliJ work?\n",
      "I'm pretty sure it runs the applications in the JVM rather than on the native image (depends on your config, but it seems rather logical). So the reflection will work as the lmitation do not apply.\n",
      "How to debug\n",
      "Try starting the application/image with the --verbose option and see where classes are loaded from. You can cross check libraray loading in IntelliJ run configuration and also add --verbose there, so it shows where jars are loaded from classpath.\n",
      "Note some external libs come with drivers included (some shade, some don't). The first class loaded wins. So in case of a clash of 2 Java classes only one is loaded (the first). If that one has different methods it might lead to unexpected behaviours. I guess this is not the case here, but if someone else stumbles across a similar issue.\n",
      "Better ways to go for\n",
      "Why go native images? They are optimized but harder to start with.\n",
      "Instead of  $ mvn -Pnative native:compile\n",
      "use $ mvn compile, so you will create a normal jar file and not an optimized native image.\n",
      "This should be located in target folder and will need the JVM to run it (native images are using GraalVM). there run in terminal java -jar rest-service-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar (maybe adjust name, but I think this step was clear anyway).\n",

      "    \n",
      "    This CL adds support into lint for \"provisional reporting\"; this is a\n",
      "    big architectural change which is key to significantly speeding up\n",
      "    the performance (and incrementality) of lint in Gradle.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    The key idea is that, for lint embedding clients which support it such\n",
      "    as Gradle, modules are analyzed one at a time, independently (and\n",
      "    possibly in parallel), without access to sources from any upstream\n",
      "    dependencies. In some cases that means they can't conclusively report\n",
      "    issues (for example, if they depend on the consuming module's\n",
      "    minSdkVersion), but the detectors record enough state such that in a\n",
      "    merging phase (reporting), they can look at their previously computed\n",
      "    results and map it into definite warnings.\n",
      "    \n",
      "    This requires many detectors to be updated to explicitly handle this new\n",
      "    mode. There are a handful of typical scenarios where a detector needs to\n",
      "    be updated: accessing the minSdkVersion of the consuming module, or\n",
      "    depending on the type of the consuming mode (e.g. is it also a library?\n",
      "    or an Android module?).\n",
      "    \n",
      "    To simplify this, most lint checks can simply pass in one of a number of\n",
      "    built-in constraints, e.g.\n",
      "        context.report(incident, minSdkAtLeast(minSdk))\n",
      "    \n",
      "    There are several mechanisms included to help catch detectors that need\n",
      "    to be updated. First, various lint APIs are not valid to be called when\n",
      "    in analysis rather than reporting mode, and if a detector calls them,\n",
      "    lint will emit a warning message.\n",
      "      Private.java: Error: The lint detector\n",
      "        com.android.tools.lint.checks.PrivateResourceDetector\n",
      "        called context.getMainProject() during module analysis.\n",
      "      This does not work correctly when running in Lint Unit Tests.\n",
      "      In particular, there may be false positives or false negatives\n",
      "      [...]\n",
      "    \n",
      "    Second, there's a new TestMode for lint's unit tests which causes all\n",
      "    unit tests to be analyzed both with and without module-independent\n",
      "    analysis. To catch common problems, in addition to running the\n",
      "    infrastructure with module-independent analysis enabled and in separate\n",
      "    and analysis phases, it also varies the minSdkVersion between the two\n",
      "    phases to ensure that the lint checks aren't just basing their analysis\n",
      "    on the module's minSdkVersion.\n",
      "    \n",

So, instead of using a version of the code that had my dirty hands on it, I used the \"gradle version\" of the Maven doc you linked: spring.io/guides/gs/convert-jar-to-war and used the \"complete\" folder to generate the war file (it has all the changes mentioned on that page). I use \"gradle war\" to generate the war and deploy that to WL. Unfortunately, I still get a 403 upon hitting my local Weblogic12C at localhost:7001/gs-convert-jar-to-war-0.1.0/\n",

With the above 2 additional changes and creating the war, weblogic12C now complains, upon deploy/activation. See error in next message:\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "does anybody know why the Spring Boot Guide includes two different types of integration tests? (https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-spring-boot#add-unit-tests)\n",
      "One with TestRestTemplate and one with MockMvc dependency? In each test type spring boot bootstraps the test environment. So what is the reason for this separation?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you use MockMvc you are testing an instance of your application in which the HTTP request cycle has been mocked. So, the test scope here is just the MVC aspects of your application. I don't think this would be typically labelled an \"integration test\", instead it is closer to a unit test (albeit its scope is considerably larger than a single class).\n",
      "When you use TestRestTemplate you are testing a real instance of your application i.e. you are 'springing up' an entire application context and invoking it as an external actor. This is typically referred to as an \"integration test\" and it is likely to be the closest test to your actual usage.\n",
      "Now, since a 'full stack' integration test invoked via TestRestTemplate can provide a superset of the coverage provided by a MockMVC test you might be wondering why you would bother with a MockMVC test. If so, then I think this is a question of ...\n",
      "\n",
      "Test scope; MockMVC test cases are typically quicker and easier to fire up (since they use less of your application context) than a full integration test. In addition, since they use less of your appolication context you may not have to work as hard to mock out any aspects of your real application context which don't play well in a test.\n",
      "Ease of use; MockMVC comes with static helpers for asserting HTTP status, interrogating and asserting against JSON responses etc. Of course YMMMV but for many people these faciliate an ease of development and help deliver readable test cases.\n",
      "\n",
      "In practice, you'll perhaps want to use a combination of both approaches:\n",
      "\n",
      "MockMVC tests for detailed testing of the entire controller layer including all mappings, happy and sad paths for all invocations and deep assertions on HTTP status codes, content bodies etc\n",
      "TestRestTemplate tests for the main flows expressed from the users perspective e.g. Save a new Foo, Search for all Foos, Submit an invalid Foo update etc with assertions focussing on the bits which your users see/are interested in.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",

      "Thank you for the detailed explanation! The only thing I can't confirm is that MockMVC tests are quicker. It takes exactly the same amount of time (on my machine)\n",

In a real software environment you will need at least :  #1 developer machine #2 server for  your Jenkins (linux for heaven's sake) and #3 Some server for your application deployment.

      "Now of course a client might thereby receive a delta update before it receives the snapshot, but that's not an issue in my case (data is versioned and those conflicts can be managed by the client).\n",
      "My concern is that by default, step 3 - querying current subscribers - would need to be a strongly consistent database read, otherwise a subscriber might miss out on an update (eg: We send out an initial snapshot. An update comes in, but due to eventual consistency, step 3 doesn't see the new subscriber yet - so they miss out!)\n",
      "That kind of sucks, because we likely need to query subscribers quite often (every time an update occurs), and having to do consistent reads will slow things down - and make them more expensive from a billing perspective!\n",
      "Are there any options to improve this?\n",
      "Ideally, I'd like to insert a step after step 5 (and before step 6) that is \"wait until the data has been pushed out to all replicas, so all weak reads after this will pick up the new subscriber\". But I don't think that is possible - please do correct me if wrong.\n",
      "Otherwise, I'm considering adding a timestamp to the  Subscribers table. Step 3 could then lodge two separate queries - a weakly consistent read for Subscribers where Timestamp <= now - 10 minutes, and a strongly consistent read for Subscribers where Timestamp > now - 10 minutes. That kind of implies it'd be safe to assume a subscriber that came in longer than 10 minutes ago should now have propagated to all nodes, and every weakly consistent read \"should\" know about them by now. I don't need to say: This feels VERY dodgy!\n",

      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "The time for eventual consistency within the base table is usually counted in single digit milliseconds, maybe up to a couple seconds in the event of something like leader node failure where a new leader must be elected. So wait three seconds before doing your EC scan and you should be comfortable that there were no changes from before the stream listening that your client would miss.\n",
      "If missing something would truly be catastrophic and you need to protect against the super rare situation where a short pause isn't a sufficient guarantee, then just do strongly consistent reads. That's what they're there for.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "Thanks. It'd be quite annoying to miss an update, but not catastrophic - if something like >99.9% of reads are correct, that should be good enough. Would it be beneficial instead of waiting a fixed amount of time, to have the event subscriber do a strongly consistent read of its just-inserted row before proceeding? It's not quite clear to me if that'd indicate that \"just\" a majority of nodes have now been sync'ed, or indeed all\n",
      "Each item inserted has its own eventual consistency propagation so that's not enough to make sure there's no other item stale still.\n",

However, the git repo (git clone https://github.com/spring-guides/tut-rest.git) has many individual java projects each with their own gradle build.  I'd like to edit the code in Eclipse, as that's the whole point, but this hasn't proved trivial.  \n",
      "So far, I've created a general project for the git repo, and then separate java projects for each of the folders from the repo, linking the source in my java projects to the source/test folders in the repo.  This has worked great except that I don't have the spring jars in my dependencies for the java projects, I get a ton of errors as well as lose the nice autocomplete of function names, etc.  \n",
      "What is the correct way to fix this?  It seems like there isn't a good way to install the jars for spring in each java project without using maven or some other build tool, which seems redundant and inefficient since I can build the source from the repo project.  If this is the case, should I make a build for each separate project even though the idea for the tutorial is that they each come with gradle?\n",

If you want to enable deployment only in normal war mode, you don't need to use spring-boot-maven-plugin at all in your pom.\n",

Removal of the spring-boot-maven-plugin and the main method should only take away the standalone executable/embedded Tomcat feature from war, nothing else (just tested this on my application and worked fine :))\n",

There are - in general - three \"forms\" of parent we see: the direct parent (i.e. the parent in the directory structure), a sibling in the directory structure (we sometimes see something like a \"build-parent\" or \"test-parent\"), or a totally different parent (like shown in the post with the spring-boot-starter-parent).\n",
      "Why are you taliking about microservices? --- \"Often the microservice-architecture rely on independendly releaseable services.\" - \"Sometimes a microservice becomes hugh and maven-module organization become interresting.\" - These two arguments are somewhat contradictory. A multi-module project is typically released \"as one\" (same version number, for example). This contradcits the indepencence of microservices. I know that we can manage versions separately, but this needs additional configuration and is more akin of a monorepo approach.\n",

The general guidelines recommend, if possible, to merge the middle tier application and the front-end UI into one AAD v2.0 application. Ofcourse, this can only be done if you have a single front-end mapped to the middle tier and won't be applicable in cases of multiple front-ends sharing the same middle tier. \n",

      "I totally agree that shouldn’t mean it doesn’t work.\n",
      "i had already read the MSDN documentation , and « a common OBO pattern cannot be used » isn’t the same as « obo flow doesn’t currently work for Microsoft personal accounts » in my opinion. I’d appreciate if you could share any additional insights other than what’s already written in MSDN.\n",
      "Also just wanted to double check if I'm getting this correctly: by \"merging into one AAD v2.0 application\" do you mean \"using the same app registration\" from both front-end & middle-tier?\n",
      "Yes, that's what I mean by merging, you can have one app registered in Azure Portal to represent both front-end and middle tier.\n",
      "As an alternative, if you do not absolutely have to use any specific delegated permission or user claim in the back-end service, you could go ahead with Client Credentials grant flow between the middle-tier component and the back-end service. Essentially, the auth between UI and user would be user-based and the auth between middle-tier and back-end would be service-principal based. Without knowing the complete scenario, its difficult to recommend any approach.\n",
      "We do have to use delegated permissions on the middle-tier to be able to make calls on behalf of the authenticated user to the downstream APIs. And I’d already interpreted the documentation the same as you did, that the recommended strategy is sharing a single app registration between front-end and middle tier but couldn’t get this work with Tenant: common (msa+aad). And the sample says « don’t use common setting for tenant, see limitations » and limitations say « it doesn’t work for personal accounts » this whole thing is very confusing and wanted to clarify it before wasting more time\n",

      "We are building a ASP.net core Web API with Angular SPA client.  For Authentication we have implemented Azure AD with multi tenants.  For the Web API authentication/authorization we have followed this Microsoft sample.  This uses the Microsoft.Identity.Web MSAL library for authenticating the authorisation code that originated from the Angular SPA.  On the Azure AD application registration we manage the correct scope of the application, but we are not able to understand how claims are managed.\n",
      "In previous applications I had run the authentication server IdentityServer4 as middleware in my application, allowing the authentication and issuing of claims in my application.  I was using UserManager to add or remove claims on the User.  Claims information was stored in the User tables of my database, and were then included in the issued cookie and available to the SPA and the Web API.\n",
      "In the current application we are fully relying on Azure AD, and now I feel I am missing a piece of the puzzle to manage the user claims (and their inclusion on the cookie/token).  Question: How can I manage claims that are specific to our application while user management and authentication takes place on Azure AD rather than in my application?\n",

      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "Our application is an Angular SPA with ASP.Net Core Web API.  The identity is provided by Microsoft Identity Platform (Azure AD) and authentication is provided by the same.  The authorization is done in Web API basis \"Application Roles\".  These \"Application Roles\" are held in the Azure AD directory (defined in the Application's manifest and assigned on the tenant domain to users).\n",
      "The Angular SPA receives the tokens from Azure, as per these instructions.  The relevant tokens that are issued are: an AccessToken for my Web API (following these instructions), an AccessToken for calling Graph API (following the same instructions) and an IdToken that includes the \"Application Roles\" as roles claim (this id token seems to be included automatically once roles have been assigned).\n",
      "The problem I face is that I need to pass concurrent tokens to my Web API, but with the HTTP interceptor I can only include 1 token in the header request.  For example, I need the first AccessToken to proof authentication to the Web API and I need to include the IdToken such that the Web API can perform authorization.\n",
      "Q: How can I call my Web API with multiple tokens, when these tokens are all issued to the SPA and need to be included in the HTTP call to my Web API?\n",

      "No matter whether you want to get Microsoft Graph data, the way you used to get Application role is incorrect.\n",
      "An id token cannot be used to perform authorization for your Web API application. You have to use access token. See this answer to learn about the usage of id token and access token.\n",
      "So you have to use an access token rather than id token.\n",
      "In this case, you configure the app roles in the Azure AD app which represents Angular SPA (the front).\n",

The provided DDL is part of the jars and can be found here github.com/spring-projects/spring-batch/blob/main/… (on github).\n",
      "Thanks for quick response! The DDLs you link to contain the changes I needed to make to BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION. The docs should really be updated to help people out. The DDLs in those docs are not just images, but text with \"Copy to clipboard\" buttons. I didn't find an obvious link to the DDLs on github in the docs. The upgrade guide doesn't mention the required BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION changes either.\n",
      "Because those are in an earlier version (4.3 I believe and not 5.x), so indeed they are not part of the 5.x migration as that should already have been done.\n",
      "That makes sense. The reference docs are incorrect, though. I assume others have struggled with this.\n",

      "This will also create a few tables in the database configured for your application. Like BATCH_JOB_EXECUTION and BATCH_STEP_EXECUTION.\n",

      "\n",
      "\n",
      "It is Spring Boot that creates that bean and adds it to the application context. Therefore, it is possible to autowire it in bean definition methods and use it to configure jobs and steps.\n",

      "Comments:\n",
      "The first one fails because you should use or @DataJpaTest (for a test slice) or @SpringBootTest for a full blown integration test. Adding both to a testcase doesn't make sense. Your tests fail because there is no @SpringBootConfiguration class to be found because you removed the application. You now basically have a regular Spring application without Spring Boot features. So you will need to manually configure your testing by providing the configuration.\n",
      "Thanks for your comment, but this is exactly what I explain (I don't have SpringBootTest because it's not an application and first case is not working because I have multiple initialisations). My question is about how to test it and which set of annotations I need. I expected the last one working.\n",
      "Why would the last one work as that still is an @SpringBootTest which cannot find the class with @SpringBootApplication to inspect it to know what to instantiate. (Or the @SpringBootConfiguration that is), without that ther will be no auto configuration.\n",
      "Could I use @SpringBootConfiguration someplace in the Test to enable the Spring Boot autoconfiguration?\n",

      "I need to incorporate WebService reader support for SOAP and REST into an existing product built around Spring Batch.\n",
      "Prior versions of the code used the reficio Soap libraries, which:\n",
      "\n",

      "have been problematic for us since day 1, and\n",

While the RestTemplate is still present, we don't want to build in technical debt by using a component that we know is going away.

      "First of all, Reactive Streams are designed for data streams\n",
      "(infinite) while Spring Batch is a batch processing framework designed\n",

      "That said, you can use both clients with Spring Batch. The point I am trying to make in the issue you shared is that it does not make sense to use a reactive item reader if other parts of the stack are not reactive. So nothing prevents you from using a reactive item reader with the current implementation, you just won't have any benefits from using it over a non reactive component.\n",

      "Thank you for the clarification.  If I understand correctly, if we shift from a purely batch modeled system to a stream modeled (spring integration) system (a complete redesign from the ground up), then it might make sense to consider going to the reactive model. But the pros and cons would need to be carefully weighted against the cost of rearchitecting.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I've been recently learning how databases work and how to write a service that can operate the database. So the situation is following:\n",
      "I have a MySQL database ran on a localhost server (XAMPP). Accessing the database is simple: localhost:3036/my_database.\n",
      "In addition to that, I wrote a Java Spring service (actually just copied the sample from https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-accessing-data-mysql.git) that is supposed to be an interface accepting curl requests and based on them to operate the database. So far so good. Everything works. The problem is that this service also runs on a localhost address: localhost:8080.\n",
      "I would like to implement the MySQL server into my Spring service so that I can just run this service and the database will run and be hosted on the same port. The data is supposed to be available only through this service so I don't want an additional independent MySQL server to be running on a different localhost port.\n",
      "At the end of the day, I would like to generate an executable jar file that when ran provides me the service on a localhost address and deals with locally stored database seamlessly.\n",
      "Edit:\n",
      "I wouldn't like my database to be independent form the service. I don't want to take care of running it and connecting to the service. What I'm searching for is sommething like @jr593 mentioned in the answers below, an embedded database. But is it possible for such databases to save the data locally on the device that the service is running beetwen service runs?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is a few solution for this.\n",
      "\n",
      "Change port for java app. It it's Spring Boot you could check property server.port and set it to e.g 8081.\n",
      "You can chcek what is working on XAMPP on port 8080 and shoud down it (it could be apache or something else)\n",
      "You don't need XAMPP to have MySQL on local host. You can stop/remove xampp and install standalone MySql, so you will take only port 3036 and nat 8080 and 3036.\n",
      "You could use Docker with MySql image instead of XAMPP.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "If I understand your question correctly, you cannot have 2 services listening on the same port\n",
      "XAMPP has mariadb and that normally runs on port 3306! Not quite sure what you mean by Accessing the database is simple: localhost:3036/my_database Did you install something other than phpMyAdmin that runs on port 3036 and does something like phpMyAdmin\n",
      "Well, you can run an embedded database inside your spring app, but you will still need to persist the data somehow, otherwise it will be lost between runs.\n",
      "It's hard to tell what you really want to achieve. MySQL is a network server. Each client connects via the configured port. Your Spring application is a web application and it is not possible to use the same port. In a production environment the database port is usually blocked and no external direct access to the database port is permitted. Clients can only connect to the webapplication port.\n",
      "I think an embedded database inside a spring app is the solution I was looking for. Thank you @jr593. An all of you as well for your comments.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I am writing a python script which will make use of azure python sdk, and inside the script I have some cases of usage of begin_create_or_update function, which is common for most modules in azure python sdk.\n",
      "However, I am having trouble figuring out the proper json pattern for each object to specify in begin_create_or_update function. I am using the git directory of azure samples as reference to figure out the proper pattern for the json. But I cannot find any official documentation regarding to required and optional argument formats for the json in begin_create_or_update function. For example, I have no clue what kind of arguments I should provide in json if I want to create a virtual machine scale set.\n",
      "I found this link which states that the usage of json patterns in the function is possible, but does not provide any link for proper documentation.\n",
      "I have also found some similarities between the json view of objects in portal azure and json pattern which is required in begin_create_or_update function. My question is if there is an official documentation for the json arguments for each type of object which begin_create_or_update function might refer to, and how can I make use of the json view in azure portal in order to figure out the pattern of json in the sdk.\n",

      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Just like ARM templates, the SDK uses the Azure API to do things like manage a VM.\n",
      "With that in mind, I believe you will find that the ARM template reference documentation has what you are looking for, documentation on the resource formats.\n",
      "This vault sample code isn't too old and therefore probably pretty close to the latest version of the API. The Microsoft.KeyVault vaults documentation is the relevant documentation.\n",
      "The one gotcha is that the SDK uses snake case e.g access_policies whereas the ARM templates use camelcase e.g accessPolicies.\n",
      "Here is a VMSS sample, and here is the respective reference documentation. Unfortunately you see there isn't a 1:1 match as the sample is 3 years old, so you would have to find the right API version in the ARM template documentation to get a perfect comparison.\n",
      "Perhaps the API version differences between what you see in the portal vs in samples is why you said you see similarities but not an exact match. Also the differences in case as mentioned above.\n",
      "I hope this is what you were looking for.\n",

      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "According to official Spring WS documentation, the Request/Response suffix are the default ones used to automatically determine request/response and as such generate the expected WSDL.\n",
      "\n",
      "The DefaultWsdl11Definition which builds a WSDL from a XSD schema. This definition iterates over all element elements found in the schema, and creates a message for all elements. Next, it creates WSDL operation for all messages that end with the defined request or response suffix. The default request suffix is Request; the default response suffix is Response, though these can be changed by setting the requestSuffix and responseSuffix properties, respectively.\n",
      "\n",
      "You can hence, in the mentioned example code, change the suffix in the WebServiceConfig configuration class, defaultWsdl11Definition method, adding the following method invocation:\n",
      "wsdl11Definition.setRequestSuffix(\"your-new-prefix-here\");\n",
      "\n",
      "You can, for instance, set it to Req instead of Request, the build will then automatically generate a new GetCountryReq class, code of ApplicationTests and CountryEndpoint would then need to be manually adapted, removing compilation errors (as they would still point to the previously existing GetCountryRequest class) but also making sure to change the localPart = \"getCountryReq\" attribute of the @PayloadRoot annotation in the CountryEndPoint class.\n",
      "I tried it and build went fine and WSDL was updated accordingly.\n",
      "That's about changing the default suffix to another suffix. But what about changing it to an empty suffix?\n",
      "wsdl11Definition.setRequestSuffix(\"\");\n",
      "\n",
      "Exception: suffix must not be empty. Spring does not support it. According to this thread:\n",
      "\n",
      "Basically, the problem is this:\n",
      "     We have to differentiate which schema elements are wsdl messages, and which aren't.\n",
      "     Of all wsdl messages, we have to figure out which are input (request) messages.\n",
      "    Of all wsdl messages, we have to figure out which are output (response) messages.  \n",
      "The DefaultWsdl11Definition figures this out by suffixes. Or, more specifically, it delegates to a SuffixBasedMessagesProvider and SuffixBasedPortTypesProvider to do so.\n",
      "  So if you have some other preferred way of determining what makes an input/output message, you will have to write your own messagesprovider and or porttypesprovider.\n",
      "Simply put: there is no generic way for Spring-WS to determine what makes up a request and a response, rather than using suffixes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: the poster of this message was Arjen Poutsma, author of the DefaultWsdl11Definition class (according to javadocs), the component which handles the automatic mapping based on these suffix conventions.\n",
      "But he leaves an open door: writing your own SuffixBasedMessagesProvider and SuffixBasedPortTypesProvider. However, he also left everything as private in the DefaultWsdl11Definition (where these providers are instantiated), hence you would also need to write (copy) your own WSDL11 definition mapper.\n",
      "Here is the process I followed then:\n",
      "\n",
      "Create your own CustomSuffixBasedMessagesProvider, overriding the setRequestSuffix method and removing the check on empty suffix, in the isMessageElement method you would need to handle the new mapping\n",
      "Create your own CustomSuffixBasedPortTypesProvider, overriding the setRequestSuffix method and removing the check on empty suffix, in the getOperationName and isInputMessage methods you would need to handle the new mapping\n",
      "Create your own CustomWsdl11Definition as a copy of the existing DefaultWsdl11Definition and instantiating your own providers created above\n",
      "Change the WebServiceConfig class, defaultWsdl11Definition method, to use your own CustomWsdl11Definition in order to apply the whole customization.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, empty suffix comes with a bit of challenge, since it would be fine for any element (that is, every element has an empty suffix). That's why I mentioned the isMessageElement, isInputMessage and getOperationName handling: on growing WSDLs, you may easily end up on harcoding the mapping (for GetCountry request, GetCountryResponse is the response) or passing a properties/map (as suggested in the thread mentioned above), but again repeating most of your XSD again in your WebServiceConfig configuration class, making it hard to maintain, troubleshoot, share.\n",
      "So, I would really suggest not to take this journey and either stick to the default suffix (if possible) or create a new one, but avoid empty suffix (they are not allowed by the library after all).\n",

      "Tokens are like bank checks: they can only be cached by the person they were written for. A token issued for the MS Graph will have as audience the Microsoft Graph, and should be accepted by the Microsoft Graph only. Any other API X receiving that token should refuse it. A client intending to invoke X should request a token for X, regardless of whether it already has a token for another service (like the Microsoft graph). Here there's an example of that flow, implemented with ADAL JS: https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/samples/active-directory-angularjs-singlepageapp-dotnet-webapi/ \n",
      "At this point Azure AD v2 (used by MSAL) is not capable of issues access tokens for custom API: the feature is being worked on, but we have no ETA for when it will become available in production. Until then, this topology isn't supported with v2 (hence MSAL JS). Sorry!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "A year later and it is now possible to secure your custom API with MSAL.  In the app portal (https://apps.dev.microsoft.com) you can create your app, then \"add a platform\" twice - once for your web app SPA, and another for your web api.  In the web api, create a \"scope\" e.g. \"api://e892d79e-03e7-4e5e-.../access_as_user\", and then pass this scope into the acquireTokenSilent call (instead of \"user.read\" in the example above).\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "So, if I understand you correctly, MSAL only provides access tokens for the Graph API?\n",
      "As of today, that's the case. The v2 endpoint issues access tokens for the Microsoft Graph and id_tokens for app sign in.\n",
      "Thank you so much for your explanation.  This has helped a lot.\n",
      "One more question, can you help me understand what's going on.  This link github.com/Azure-Samples/… seems to indicate that they are securing a custom Node API with AD v2.  (Granted they're not using MSAL)  I understood you to say this wasn't possible.  What am I missing?\n",
      "that sample cannot actually work without the access token feature discussed here- thanks for the headsup! I contacted the authors of the sample, we'll adjust language (or pull until we have the service side feature) accordingly.\n",

      "Title: Angular app which invokes B2C-secured Function App API receives 500, Function receives 404\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "Angular site hosted on an Azure storage account as a static website receives 500 when it's invoking an Azure B2C-protected Function App function. The function is receiving a 404.\n",
      "\n",
      "Update\n",
      "The original title for this question was \"Angular app which invokes B2C-secured Functions App receives 401 Unauthorized response\". The solution was, as @Alex AIT suggested (below), to replace the https://<b2c_tenant_name>.b2clogin.com/<b2c_tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration?p=<SignUpAndSignInPolicyName> in the Function App's Issuer URL with https://<b2c_tenant_name>.b2clogin.com/<b2c_tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/. I.e., remove the trailing .well-known/openid-configuration?p=<SignUpAndSignInPolicyName> segments. In a subsequent chat session, Alex pointed out that the policy is part of the path such as https://<tenantname>.b2clogin.com/<tenantname>.onmicrosoft.c‌​om/<policyname>/v2.0 or https://<tenantname>.b2clogin.com/<tenantguid>/<policyname>/v2.0. However either of those paths for the Function App's Issuer URL reverts to the 401 response.\n",
      "After resolving the 401 issue, the Angular SPA app now receives 500. However, the invoked API function is receiving a 404. The Function App's log stream indicates Failed to download OpenID configuration from 'https://<b2c_tenant_name>.b2clogin.com/<b2c_tenant_name>.onmicrosoft.com/v2.0/.well-known/openid-configuration': The remote server returned an error: (404) Not Found. So the policy is not getting attached.\n",
      "\n",
      "My objective is to establish a secure, serverless Angular web application which is statically-hosted on an Azure Storage website (i.e., within the storage account's $web container). There are two projects: a public SPA Angular 7+ project and a protected API Function App project. Because Azure storage account static websites only allow public anonymous access to all files, the Angular app-hosting blob container's files (the website's files) are not secured. But the Angular app's invocations of the Azure Functions API calls are secured. The Function App API project is protected via Azure AD B2C authentication.\n",
      "Toward this end, I have attempted to adapt the technique outlined in Single-Page Application built on MSAL.js with Azure AD B2C and Node.js Web API with Azure AD B2C. I was able to get these samples to run. And furthermore I was able to modify their settings to authenticate against my own Azure B2C tenant (rather than against Microsoft's B2C tenant) and run them locally. But I didn't attempt to deploy these sample projects to Azure and figure out the required tweaks for the settings. I skipped the deployment exercise because I'm not a Node.js developer.\n",
      "But my subsequent adaptation of the code in those (Node.js) sample projects to my statically-hosted Angular SPA project and to my Azure Functions API project is yielding 401 Unauthorized whenever the API is invoked from the SPA. So I would like to understand how to resolve this issue.\n",

The sample is calling this protected resource, but the sample has hard coded the domain login.microsoftonline.com, which then causes issues with the passport library (middleware), which extracts and validates the access_token, propagates the claims in the access_token to the verify callback and lets the framework finish the remaining authentication process. \n",
      "Because the web api is using a different authority, the passport library is unable to validate the token because the format of the authority url between login.microsoftonline.com and {tenantName}.b2clogin.com are different. For example, when using {tenantName}.b2clogin.com, the policy has to be included, but when previously using login.microsoftonline.com, it was not necessary to include the policy in the url for passport to validate the token.\n",

      "\n",
      "I'm trying to use Azure Active Directory B2C for my authentication flow for an SPA with a Node JS API. I'm using the code samples provided in the official tutorials (https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-msal-singlepageapp and https://github.com/Azure-Samples/active-directory-b2c-javascript-nodejs-webapi). I've set up everything correctly as far as I know, and I've created Facebook and Google IDP registrations according to the documentation provided. I've set up the b2cPolicies using the default SignUpSignIn User Flow, so there's really nothing to configure there except to specify that I'm using email, Google and Facebook. I'm able to authenticate into Azure's sample SPA with both Google and Facebook without issue, the id_tokens are fine. When I click the button to access the /hello endpoint from the sample API, only the email and Facebook flows produce the correct access_token from the myMSALObj.aquireTokenSilent call, however, when using Google, the \"Choose an Account\" popup appears a second time. When I'm only logged into a single account, it appears briefly and vanishes again, but when logged into multiple accounts, I have to select one again. This is kind of a terrible user experience, is there some way around this?\n",

      "In the acquireTokenSilent() call, pass in a parameter within the MSAL config object: login_hint=emailaddress. Then use Custom Policy to pass this value back to the Google IdP, such that Google skips its account selection page.\n",
      "You can do that by adding an input claim to the Google technical profile:\n",
      "      <InputClaims>\n",
      "        <InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\"login_hint\" DefaultValue=\"{OIDC:LoginHint}\" />\n",
      "      </InputClaims>\n",
      "\n",
      "The above will use the OIDC claims resolver to pull in the value from the login_hint query parameter, and send that value as a query parameter called login_hint to Google.\n",

      "This works great, I added request.loginHint = myMSALObj.getAccount().idToken.email; to the \"getTokenPopup\" method in the sample JavascriptSPA repo. The custom policy was a bit trickier to figure out without any prior experience, but I managed to stumble through after adding a \"login_hint\" ClaimType. The only odd thing is that aquireTokenSilent still fails in an incognito tab, even if I log into the google account prior to running the code sample, but it's not a blocker by any means.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Your code is working as expected. After you've implemented Persistable you can see that @CreatedDate annotation is working.\n",
      "Sure that createdDate is null on the second call of save because the object already exists in the database and you updated it with createdDate = null. As you can see from the documentation for @CreatedDate:\n",
      "\n",
      "@CreatedDate annotation. This identifies the field whose value is set\n",
      "  when the entity is persisted to the database for the first time.\n",
      "\n",
      "So not to overwrite your createdDate with null on the second call you should retrieve your customer from the database with c = repository.findOne(\"test_id\"); and then update it.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Add @EnableMongoAuditing to the main method in your spring boot application.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "The simplest solution is to add a version property (annotated with @Version) to your Customer class and leave it uninitialized. this will assign the value of 0 to any newly created object which in turn tells spring that this is a new object.\n",
      "  @Version private Long version;\n",
      "\n",
      "Note: that this version will be automatically incremented upon each modifications on this object\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "Thank you, Orest. Looks like it is the way you describe it. But it means that I need to manage the field myself. Why do i need annotation then? Isn't it created to automatically manage these fields? Perhaps only when ID is automatically generated as well.\n",
      "Yes, of course. For next update there is @LastModifiedDate, which is set automatically on update. I just thought that a field marked with @CreatedDate would automatically be skipped on update. Thanks anyway!\n",
      "I agree with and_rew. I expected the field annotationed with @CreatedDate to be set with the initial insert date, and to keep that value on subsequent updates. Why the hell would I want the creation date to be removed on updates? The whole point of auditing is to keep that information.\n",
      "You're trying to create a new object with same ID and expect to get creation date from old object. You have two options here: 1. get object by id, update some fields and then save it. 2. Write a method to update only field that you need. I think the best will second option to make sure you're not overriding some fields\n",
      "this is annoying for kotlin data classes. When I do an update I create a new object with the same id.\n",
      "Thanks! It helps me! Without version field it doesn't init createdDate fields\n",

      "This is a method of constructing queries implemented behind-the-scenes of Spring Data JPA. It definitely looks like magic, but it's Spring's way of hiding the complexity of writing queries. By extending from MongoRepository, Spring automatically creates queries based on the method names you define within your repository interface.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",

      "I can see five reasons one might do this:\n",
      "\n",
      "When you want to allow for a value that will not only change over time (you could still accomplish that with a property!), but the place you need to check to find it might change. For example, by default you check an environment variable, but there's a user option somewhere that will instead look in a config file, or a web service, or database table, etc. Now you can swap out the function call, rather than checking that config option every time inside a function that must know how to do all of those.\n",
      "It makes it just very slightly easier to use this in an async context, where you can await the results. You can await the function in a task directly, rather than having to also wrap the property as an awaitable method.\n",
      "They wanted function semantics rather than property semantics. This is a choice, where they wanted to present a function call as the public API for the type instead of a property. The lambda, then, (really: expression bodied member) is just a shorter way to write the method.\n",

      "When running their sample without changing their connection information (i.e. connecting to their fabrikamb2c tenant), it will pull up a login page in the Chrome browser. If I tell it to connect to a different account it pulls up my existing Microsoft accounts--so looking at a Microsoft AD tenant. Also, if I create my own AD B2C tenant and put that connection info into the sample it still tries to authenticate me against the Microsoft tenant rather than my new AD B2C tenant.\n",

Second, I took that project and I updated the configuration for my own newly-created ad b2c tenant. And third, I have my own project that was working using the previous version of MSAL and I updated it to use the new version.\n",

I had tried it that way since that is what is in the sample, but it didn't work and I didn't see that in any documentation so I removed it. I put it back again as you can see in the code, but the application just disappears when it gets to the AcquireTokenAsync call. You can see it open the browser and try to go to login.microsoftonline.com, but then it appears that it crashes and disappears and no exception is thrown.\n",

What's happening right now is that you're not properly indicating which policy to use, and MSAL is defaulting back to the regular Microsoft login page, which only allows Microsoft personal & work/school accounts.\n",
      "When using MSAL, the proper way to indicate policy is to use tfp in the path of the authority, like:\n",

My problem now is that after authentication, the browser on the phone gives the message \"Safari can't open the page because the address is invalid.  Any idea what address its talking about?  When I run the demo, somehow after I validate, the webview closes and I'm back to the app which is what I want to do in mine.  I tried putting my credentials in the demo, I get the same result.\n",

I'm just trying to get a token back to my app's code, so I would like to dismiss the webform and return control to my code.   But instead I am stuck with the popup.    (This all works fine and as expected in the sample, but when I put in my own credentials, as best as I can figure them out based on the notes in the sample, I get this error.)\n",
      "I'm thinking it must have to do something with the scopes or redirect settings on the Tenant, but its all very opaque on the page and in the documentation what any of this means E.g. what is a \"scope?\" in the first place,  and why is the value as the scope argument in thhe sample a url?  \n",

      "Scopes are mostly necessary when you're calling an API. Think of them like permissions. For example, you could have a \"tasks list\" api that stores your tasks for the day. Suppose you want your app to be able to \"read\" from the API. So you call Azure AD B2C, and request an access token that gives you the ability to \"read\" from the API. You would do this by inserting \"read\" as one of the scopes in your request. \n",
      "The problem is, any API can have a read scope, so to distinguish which API you are referring to, you use the App ID URI. So in Azure AD B2C, you set the App ID URI as \"https://tenantName.onmicrosoft.com/tasksList\". Then when you're making the request, you specify the scope as \"https://tenantName.onmicrosoft.com/tasksList/read\" (notice that 'read' was added to the end of that \"URL\")\n",

      "Redirect URI's ( how to return to your app )\n",
      "Leaving the browser and returning to your app is mostly done using the redirect uri. The MSALxxxxxx://oauth is the redirect uri path that you (according to your screenshot) have registered with B2C. That looks good. When you're making the call to Azure AD B2C, you need to make sure the redirect URI is set to that value. When Azure AD B2C generates a token, it will send it forward to that redirect URI.\n",
      "Now, the app needs to receive that token. This is done by listening to a uri scheme, which is everything before the colon. In this case, the URI scheme is MSALxxxxxx. To configure your xamarin app to listen to that URI scheme, follow step 6 in this sample. That steps helps you configure the return URI for each kind of platform. Now, whenever the browser detects a redirect to MSALxxxx, it will send the message forward to your app. In this case, you will receive a B2C token in your message.\n",
      "By the way, \"urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob\" is just a default redirect URI that we provide. We recommend you only use it for testing purposes, and that you create a unique redirect URI scheme for your app.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm having some difficulty getting one of the sample Xamarin.Forms/Azure applications to work with my own Azure B2C tenant, specifically active-directory-b2c-xamarin-native.\n",
      "I was able to get the sample to work out of the box, my only change being to update all the XF NuGet packages.  At this point both the Android (on my Google Pixel) and UWP versions worked perfectly; on iOS I was able to log in/out and edit the profile (it still has the known issue that iPhoneSimulator doesn't properly save tokens in the keychain, so the API and caching doesn't work, but i'm ignoring that for now until i can get an actual iPhone).  The problems started when I tried to set up and use my own B2C tenant, according to the instructions in the readme file.  Since the original sample works, it's safe to assume that the code is ok; the only changes I made were to the magic strings at the top of App.cs, and the redirect URI's stored in AndroidManifest.xml and Info.plist.  So the working theory is that I either entered one of those strings wrong, or the B2C setup is wrong.  I've gone over this multiple times now and I can't find the issue.  I'm willing to bet these are all caused by the same mistake on my part, though.\n",
      "Problem 1 (solved).  UWP app does not allow login.  Instead when the embedded browser opens I get the message \"We can't connect to the service you need right now. Check your network connection or try this again later\", followed by an \"MsalException: WAB authentication failed\" dialog once I dismiss the browser.\n",
      "This was the only issue I was able to fix so far, either by commenting out this line in the UWP.MainPage constructor:\n",
      "UserDetailsClient.Core.App.PCA.RedirectUri = WebAuthenticationBroker.GetCurrentApplicationCallbackUri().ToString();\n",
      "\n",
      "or by adding the value returned by that GetCurrentApplicationCallbackUri() call (which is something like \"ms-app://s-1-15-2-900855338....\") to the Custom Redirect URI list of the UI app in B2C.  I would prefer simply removing the line of code, but that begs the question as to why that line of code was needed in the first place. Perhaps someone can suggest why using the ms-app:// redirect on the backend might be preferable to the msalXXXX://auth used by the other platforms.  I have no idea why the original sample worked with the ms-app:// redirect; perhaps that string is actually constant across all apps and is already defined in the sample's B2C tenant. \n",
      "Problem 2.  Having gotten past the UWP login issue now everything works on that platform EXCEPT for the API call.  I get a 401 Unauthorized.\n",
      "The API code is taken straight from the tutorial Develop Cloud Connected Mobile Apps with Xamarin and Microsoft Azure; it's just the backend from Chapter 1, with the [Authorize] attribute added to the TodoItemController.  (All of the Chapter 1 code works, btw)  App Service Authentication is still turned off on the API itself (not the B2C tenant) in Azure. If I remove the Authorize attribute from the TodoItemController, it works, provided I also pass in the additional header ZUMO-API-VERSION=2.0.0. Adding the header does not help with the 401, though.\n",
      "Since I'm able to login, I'm guessing I have a valid access token, it's just not what the backend is expecting.  Again, this works on the sample, so I don't know how my app differs.  I suspect this issue also affects iOS and Android, but I'm not sure because unable to complete the login on those platforms.  Which brings me to...\n",
      "Problem 3.  On Android & iOS, on clicking SIGN IN the app opens the system browser and I'm able to login in, but the subsequent redirect doesn't happen and the app remains in it's initial state.  When debugging, the line after the call to App.PCA.AcquireTokenAsync() is never reached.  No exception is raised.\n",
      "From what I understand this is generally due to either the redirect URI being improperly formed or forgetting to add the platform-specific redirect code (intent-filter on Android, or OpenUrl on iOS).  I've double-checked the URI a half-dozen times, and the code has to be correct since the sample worked.  I did notice the ActivityManager START entry in the Android logcat, so the browser is sending the redirect, but the app isn't responding to it for whatever reason.  Note also that the UWP client DOES work using that same msalXXXX://auth URI  (this is why I bothered to explain problem 1 above)\n",

      "authenticationService.SetParent(this);\n",
      "\n",
      "This doesn't work for the Prism app, authenticationService is null. For the record, the DependencyService used here is Xamarin.Forms.DependencyService.\n",

      "By design, Prism no longer works directly with the Xamarin.Forms DependencyService as this is a complete anti-pattern. That said if you follow the guidance for registering Platform Specific types you can see how to use the IPlatformInitializer to register platform specific types. It is important to realize here that the IPlatformInitializer is called before RegisterTypes is called in PrismApplication.\n",
      "What I would suggest is to introduce a IParentWindowProvider like:\n",

I am not an expert of Azure Search. By scanning through the SDK APIs, I found you could set DataSource.Container.Query property when you create a new DataSource. Is that what you need?\n",

You could follow the REST example I posted to get the query syntax. Once all the needed properties of the DataSource object have been set, you could use the following API to create the data source in Azure Search Service: public static DataSource Create( \tthis IDataSourcesOperations operations, \tDataSource dataSource, \tSearchRequestOptions searchRequestOptions = null )\n",

      "The main thing is, you shouldn't be using the Chrome timer to measure the performance of azure search. Use the \"elapsed-time\" field of the HTTP response you receive (take an average over multiple call), since it accurately tells you how much time was spent getting your results from azure search. The chrome timer can be affected by your network/machine configuration. If that doesn't help, you can follow the other tips I suggested in the post I linked above.\n",

Please edit your question accordingly. As currently written, this is unfortunately off-topic as \"too broad.\"\n",

      "Your Question is not clearly written, and lacks sufficient detail & info. But it seems like you are seeing delays in perceiving value changes to a TextArea. \n",
      "I suspect you may be accessing the value of the TextArea from another threads. \n",
      "If so, you must keep in mind that there may be a delay between (a) the user typing text as data-entry in the web browser client-side, and (b) that typed text arriving server-side to be stored in the state of the actual widget.\n",
      "Your Vaadin app really lives on the server in Java, with it UI remotely rendered automagically by the Vaadin framework client-side in the web browser using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, etc. That client-side framework accepts the user’s typing and passes it automatically back to the server-side for storage in a Java object (the TextArea instance). \n",
      "But how often is that server-side object updated with the user’s typing? How much of a delay is involved? That depends on the ValueChangeMode  you specify with the methods TextArea::setValueChangeMode and TextArea::getValueChangeMode. The constants BLUR, EAGER, LAZY, and TIMEOUT each prescribe a different timing. The default is LAZY, documented as:\n",
      "\n",
      "On every user event, schedule a server-side event after a defined interval, cancelling the currently-scheduled event if any. This is a good choice if you want to, for instance, wait for a small break in the user's typing before sending the event.\n",
      "\n",
      "To speed up the delivery of user input to server-side, change the mode to EAGER to update nearly on every keystroke. But this will increase network traffic, making your app much more “chatty”. Not good with poor internet connections but perhaps fine on a local network. \n",
      "To move the user input to server-side less frequently, choose BLUR to deliver input only after the keyboard focus leaves that field to move to another field or other widget. \n",
      "So, when you access the TextArea instance’s current value, it may not actually be so current. While the user is typing, that fresh text may not yet have made the voyage across the network from browser-side HTML/JavaScript to server-side Java object.\n",
      "By the way, if working with the TextArea from another thread, be sure you do so properly through the UI.access and VaadinSession.access methods. Never directly access user-interface widgets from a background thread.\n",

      "Title: AWS Cognito Sign-In with Java SDK for desktop application\n",
      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I searched a lot, but it seems impossible to find a solution from start to finish to this topic. As a premise, I've already implemented Cognito sign-up, sign-in and refresh of credentials in two native apps for both iOS and Android, so I have developed a (at least) basic understanding of the authentication flow.\n",
      "These mobile apps use the simplest cognito setup possible: a user pool, an identity pool with a IAM role for authenticated users and no unauthenticated usage possible. I'm not using (at least for now) Facebook, Google or Amazon login, nor other authentication methods.\n",
      "Now I need to make a desktop version of those apps in Java, and it seems to me a completely different beast. What I would like to do is this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Open the login window in my Java desktop application;\n",
      "Insert username and password in their fields and press a login button;\n",
      "Getting some credentials and start using the application connecting to other AWS services, specifically I need to use S3, Lambda and DynamoDB.\n",
      "\n",
      "The way to achieve this is on paper reasonably simple:\n",
      "\n",
      "Get a token from a Cognito user pool;\n",
      "Give this token to a Cognito identity pool in exchange for some credentials;\n",
      "Use this credentials to access other AWS services.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "After reading a lot of documentation, downloading a lot of different projects examples and a lot of despair, I've eventually found the way to implement this in the mobile apps. For example, in Android the authentication flow works like this:\n",
      "\n",
      "Instantiate a CognitoUserPool, using a UserPoolID, an AppClientID, a PoolRegion and (optionally) a ClientSecret;\n",
      "Instantiate a credential provider, using an IdentityPoolID and a PoolRegion;\n",
      "In the app UI, insert a username and password, and press the Login button;\n",
      "Retrieve a CognitoUser using that username from the UserPool instantiated earlier;\n",
      "Get a CognitoUserSession for that CognitoUser, using an AuthenticationHandler with various callbacks to pass the password when needed;\n",
      "Add that CognitoUserSession to the credentials provider instantiated earlier, in form of a TokenKey + the JWT token extracted from the session.\n",
      "At this point, whenever I need to access S3, Lambda or DynamoDB, I simply pass this credentials provider as a parameter for their clients constructors.\n",
      "\n",
      "To implement the same functionality with the Java SDK seems to me much more difficult. \n",
      "I managed to implement users Sign-Up fairly easily. However with users Sign-In I don't know where to start at all. \n",
      "Every example does this in a different way. On top of that, every example uses particular use cases such as developer authenticated Sign-Ins, or custom urls to connect to some owned backend. Why is so difficult to find an example for a basic use case like the one I need? I'm starting to think my basic use case is not basic at all, but rather atypical. Why would login with a username and a password against the default users/credentials service for AWS be atypical, however, I don't really know.\n",
      "The best I've done so far is copying the relevant classes from this example project (from which I've also taken the Sign-Up part, that works pretty well) and getting to print the IdToken, AccessToken and RefreshToken in the console. They are printed correctly and are not null.\n",
      "What I cant't really understand is how to get the credentials and add them to a credentials provider in order to instantiate the clients to access other AWS services. The only way I see in the project to do that is to call the method\n",
      "Credentials getCredentials(String accessCode)\n",
      "which I suppose it should accept the access code retrieved with the InitAuth method (that starts an OAuth2.0 authentication flow, please correct me if I am wrong). The problem is that I can't find a way to retrieve that code. I can't find an online example of an access code to see how it looks. I tried to put one of the tokens and the web request responds\n",
      "{\"error\":\"invalid_grant\"}\n",
      "\n",
      "which suggests its not a valid code, but at least the web request is valid.\n",
      "To make it more clear, what I can do is this:\n",
      "String username; //retrieved from UI\n",
      "String password; //retrieved from UI\n",
      "\n",
      "//I copied AuthenticationHelper as is from the project\n",
      "AuthenticationHelper helper = new AuthenticationHelper(POOL_ID, CLIENT_APP_ID, CLIENT_SECRET);\n",
      "\n",
      "//I then retrieve the tokens with SRP authentication\n",
      "AuthenticationResultType result = helper.performSRPAuthentication(username, password);\n",
      "\n",
      "//Now I can successfully print the tokens, for example:\n",
      "System.out.println(result.getAccessToken());\n",
      "\n",
      "How can I retrieve the credentials from here? Where I should put the identity pool id? In Android I simply add the JWT token to an HashMap and use it like \n",
      "credentialsProvider.setLogins(loginsMap).\n",
      "Furthermore, this project contain classes with hundreds of lines of code, BigInteger variables, hardcoded strings of many lines of random characters (some sort of key or token I suppose) and other black magic like that (especially in the AuthenticationHelper class). Another thing I don't like about this solution is that it retrieves credentials through manually written web requests (with another separated class created ad hoc to make the request). Really isn't there in the Java SDK some handy method that wraps all those things in a bunch of elegant lines of code? Why call it an SDK than? The iOS and Android SDKs handle all that on their own in such a simpler way. Is this due to the fact that they expect a developer of desktop app to be way more able/expert, in contrast to the average guy that some day, getting up from bed, decides to make an iOS/Android app [alludes to himself]? This would explain their effort to make the mobile SDKs so developer-friendly in comparison.\n",
      "Onestly I find really hard to believe that I have to do that, reading who knows what on a doc page who knows where, to Sign-In a user, which makes me think that I'm really missing something. I literally read every stack exchange question and documentation I was able to find. The fact is that there is almost always an AWS documentation page for what I need, but to actually find it is not so simple sometimes, at least for Cognito documentation.\n",
      "I read that I can put a file with the needed credentials in the PC filesystem and the Java SDK will use those credentials to access all the resources, however from my understanding this method is reserved to Java applications running on a server as a backend (servlets), where the end user can't access them through his browser. My application is a desktop app for end-users, so I can't even consider to leave AWS credentials on the user PC (please correct me if I'm wrong, I would really love to make something so simple).\n",
      "\n",
      "What really scares me is that Sign-In with a user pool and identity pool might not be possible at all. I know that Cognito related stuff was added to the Java SDK much later it was available for iOS, Android and JavaScript. But if they added it, I suppose It should support an authentication flow at least similar to those of the mobile counterparts.\n",
      "What worsen the problem even more is that I initially made all the functionalities of my application to work offline. I thought that I would have eventually integrated AWS in the app. In this way the application is a bit more modular, and the AWS related stuff in concentrated in a package, detatched from the rest of the application logic and UI. In my sea of ignorance this seems a good practice to me, but now, if I cannot manage to resolve this problem, I've thrown months of work in the trash, only to realize that I have to build a web app beacuse JavaScript is much more supported.\n",
      "Even on MobileHub the only options to create a ClientApp on Cognito is for iOS, Android, JavaScript and React-something.\n",
      "When documentation or examples are provided for other languages/SDKs, Java is often omitted and the most frequent I see among the options is .NET.\n",
      "To make my frustration even bigger, everytime I search something on a search engine, the fact that the word \"Java\" is contained in the word \"JavaScript\" obfuscates the few results that could be useful, because all the JavaScript SDK related stuff is generally higher ranked in the search engines than Java's (this could explain in part why .NET related stuff seems more easy to find, at least on StackOverflow or others Q&A sites).\n",
      "\n",
      "To conclude, all of this created some questions in my head:\n",
      "\n",
      "Why so few people seem to need this authentication method (with username and password)? It seems to me a pretty common and reasonable use case for a desktop application. I know that web apps growth is through the roof, but given that Java is one of the most used languages today, how is it possible that nobody needs to do a simple login from a desktop application? Which leads to the next question:\n",
      "Is there something inherently bad/wrong/risky/stupid in using the Java SDK for a desktop application? Is it intended only for usage on a server as backend or for a web app? What should be the solution than, to make a desktop application that connects to AWS services? It is wrong to do an AWS connected desktop app at all? Should a web app the only option to consider? Why? I opted for Java to implement an application that would run on Widows, macOS and Linux. I also chose Java because i thought it would be mostly similar to the Android SDK in its usage, given its code should be indipendent from the platform UI, making simple to reuse code. I was wrong.\n",
      "If there's nothing wrong in using the Java SDK like this, could some\n",
      "good soul please help me find an example that goes from putting a\n",
      "username and a password in two fields, and instantiate a client to\n",
      "access other AWS services (such as an S3 client) in a Java desktop\n",
      "application?\n",
      "\n",
      "Tell me everything you need to know and I'll edit the question.\n",
      "Please someone help me, I'm loosing my mind.\n",

      "IMHO is it intentional. If your code runs on WebLogic (which is also Oracle product) then the setup is quite easy (see danielveselka.blogspot.cz/2009/07/…). I'm afraid other application servers do not offer JMS to AQ connectors(resource adapters).\n",
      "No, I do not want to connect to WebLogic, but directly to Oracle Advanced Queueing (AQ). In my program without Spring Boot I use: `\t\t\tqconFactory = AQjmsFactory.getQueueConnectionFactory(hostName, serviceName, port, \"thin\"); \t\t\tqcon = qconFactory.createQueueConnection(userName, password); \t\t\tqsession = qcon.createQueueSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE); \t\t\tqueueTable = ((AQjmsSession) qsession).getQueueTable(userName, queueTableName); \t\t\tqueue = ((AQjmsSession) qsession).getQueue(userName, queueName); `\n",
      "What as was trying explain was. Oracle AQ can act as standard Java EE JMS provider. Which might make your transition from ActiveMQ much easier. (In fact there would be no changes in the source code). But this might work only under some circumstances.\n",
      "I'm also interested in this. Not the migration so much, but Oracle AQ in Spring.\n",
      "Thanks for your answer. Great for everyone using WebLogic.   However how can I connect to Oracle Advanced Queueing (AQ) WITHOUT THE NEED OF WEBLOGIC.  So what is the Spring Boot Oracle AQ equivalent of the ActiveMQ code in the Getting Started with JMS example, see [Spring Boot Getting started JMS][1]   Or the the [spring-boot-sample-activemq example on Github][2]    [1]: spring.io/guides/gs/messaging-jms   [2]: github.com/spring-projects/spring-boot/tree/master/…\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm experimenting with examples from this official Spring tutorials and there is a dependency on this code:\n",
      "https://github.com/spring-guides/gs-async-method/tree/master/complete\n",
      "If you look at the code on AppRunner.java  class, I have 2 questions:\n",
      "\n",
      "When server is starting, if I put a breakpoint in this class's constructor, seems like in the constructor, the GitHubLookupService is provided by spring, using the @Service bean that was configured. BUT, there was no @Autowired annotation on the constructor, so how in the world this constructor get called with the right dependency?  It was supposed to be null.\n",
      "\n",
      "Is it an automatic assumption of Spring Boot?\n",
      "Does Spring see \"private field + constructor argument, and it assumes it should look for an appropriate bean?\n",
      "Is it Spring Framework or Spring boot?\n",
      "Am I missing something?\n",
      "\n",
      "As I remember, it was mendatory to provide default constructor to beans / service etc. How come this class (AppRunner) doesn't have a default constructor?\n",
      "How does Spring knows that it should run the constructor with the argument?\n",
      "Is it because it is the only constructor?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Starting with Spring 4.3, if a class, which is configured as a Spring bean, has only one constructor, the @Autowired annotation can be omitted and Spring will use that constructor and inject all necessary dependencies.  \n",
      "Regarding the default constructor: You either need the default constructor, a constructor with the @Autowired annotation when you have multiple constructors, or only one constructor in your class with or without the @Autowired annotation.\n",
      "Read the @Autowired chapter from the official Spring documentation for more information.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Think of it this way... Suppose you have the following component:\n",
      "@Component \n",
      "public class FooService {\n",
      "    public FooService(Bar bar) { /*whatever*/ }\n",
      "}\n",
      "\n",
      "When Spring is scanning this class, it wants to know how it should go about constructing an instance. It's using reflection so it can get a list of all of the constructors at runtime.\n",
      "In this case, it is completely unambiguous how Spring must construct this instance. There's only one constructor so there is no decision to be made, and no ambiguity at all.\n",
      "If you add @Autowired here, you are not narrowing anything down, and you are not giving Spring any extra information to help make its decision - its decision is already made because there is only one candidate.\n",
      "And so, as a convenience, the Spring team decided @Autowired should be optional. Since its not helping the Spring framework to make a decision, its presence is just noise.\n",
      "If your component has multiple constructors then you can use @Autowired on one of them to tell Spring \"use this one, not that one\".\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "Here the quote from the official documentation :    As of Spring Framework 4.3, an @Autowired annotation on such a constructor is no longer necessary if the target bean only defines one constructor to begin with. However, if several constructors are available, at least one must be annotated to teach the container which one to use.\n",
      "In order for Spring to inject dependencies without using @Autoriwred, the field you declare needs to be declared as final.\n",
      "1+. we use some constructors for testing purposes only and we do not want them to be used for Spring injection, @Autowired on only one of them was the solution I found in this answer. thank you!\n",

(App level scopes work just fine in a B2C registration, btw) There is text on that page that claims that an interactive session is possible. But no demo. It's also where all the links that used to go to the AD Graph demos now go. It also prompts questions: Why take away instructions and access to documentation that worked before? And: Why put a UI in front of ppl implying something impossible is possible? Why aren't they clear that it can't be done?\n",
      "Ah right, I guess app permissions work in a B2C registration now since they are now unified :) But yeah know you can't do that in a desktop app :\\ Definitely add an issue on the documentation page if you find oddities like that by the way. The teams answer those pretty well usually.\n",
      "Just means I have to build middleware. Since it interfaces with an ASP.NET Core site that participates in the B2C login flow, I have a use case and a place to put the app secret, but you have to know it'd be a lot easier if they wouldn't lead me on like that in documentation or move to hide the previous stuff.

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm just starting to explore the MS identity platform and came across this example repo for a node web app. In it under App > routes > auth.js the /aquireToken route sets the authCodeUrlRequestParams and authCodeRequestParams. This includes the scopes for the request dont in the redirectToAuthCodeUrl() function.\n",

      "Ensure that values for redirectUri and scopes in AuthorizationCodeUrlRequest and AuthorizationCodeRequest are the same\n",
      "\n",
      "Naturally, I tried this without the same scopes and noticed that it still works. When adding another scope to the authCodeUrlRequestParams object of the /aquireToken route (e.g. Calendars.Read) but not authCodeRequestParams, the app still works and I get access to the data protected by this scope. When switching the scopes the request fails (which makes sense, as the auth URL doesn't include the missing scope).\n",
      "But why does it work when the scopes are included in the auth URL but not the request object?\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Like we know, authCodeUrlRequestParams is used to generate an auth code and we can use auth code to generate access token using AAD auth code flow.\n",
      "And I had a test before, like you can see Files.ReadWrite.All is a scope which doesn't require Admin consent.\n",
      "\n",
      "So after added this API permission without admin consent, and I didn't add this scope when generate auth code, but added it when generate access token, it gave me an error.\n",
      "\n",
      "But if I added Files.ReadWrite.All when generating auth code, since this scope doesn't have admin consent, I would see a user consent popup after I signed in with my account which let me consent this app to have some permissions. And I consent the permissions and got an auth code, then I used this code I can get an access token which containing Files.ReadWrite.All in scp claim.\n",
      "\n",
      "By the way, in screenshot above, you can see I only set User.Read in the request, but the what scopes I get are far more than a single User.Read, other scopes are from the auth code. I set scope profile email openid offline_access for generateing auth code.\n",
      "So my opinion is, we have to contain the scope which doesn't require admin consent and hasn't got admin consent but we required in authCodeUrlRequestParams, so that we can give user consent for this scope, and we can use the code to generate an access token containing this scope even we don't set it in authCodeRequestParams.\n",
      "If the scope we required is already got consent by admin no matter it required admin consent or not, we don't need to add it in authCodeUrlRequestParams and only need to add it in authCodeRequestParams and we can get correct access token. Screenshot below, the Group.Read.All has got admin consent.\n",

      "Without pure bytecode support as you noted here the story for Python usage for CosmosDB with Gremlin is not so good. There are some mechanisms for translating bytecode to script representations like GroovyTranslator for Java and Translator for Javascript. For example, in Javascript you could do:\n",

Unfortunately, there is no support for this functionality in Python at this time.

The first is the one which happens every 60 minutes (or whatever you set it to) and another one which requires the user to re-login if it's set (default 90 days).

      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm using MSAL for B2C with Android and it I have been following this example. When first logging on I use #1 acquire token / run user flow and #3 Acquire token silently when I need to call an API and my token has expired.\n",
      "The silent token seems to map to Access & ID token lifetimes (minutes) in the Azure Portal.\n",
      "\n",
      "The user flow for susi seems to map to Lifetime length (days) in the portal:\n",
      "\n",
      "I think the 90 days are up, so what do I do to refresh that token and how do I tell if I'm close to the 90 days?\n",
      "Maybe I'm not understanding this completely.\n",
      "UPDATE\n",
      "Ok, I saw the response below which was helpful, but I don't know if or how my use case can be achieved given the information provided.\n",
      "Here is the use case:\n",
      "I have an app which can be used in disconnected mode, and frequently is, on a shared device. The app does need to be connected to be downloaded and for user registration on the device. When the device is connected it also sends data to the cloud, but otherwise stores it locally. When sending data to the cloud it needs to have a silent refresh of the token.\n",
      "All of this has been working until the 90 days are hit and I need to re-authenticate. This would be a good policy but given the disconnected nature of the app I would like to start asking the user using a snackbar as the countdown gets closer. According to the response there is now way to determine the 90 expiration, and I have seen this as the profile.getExpiresOn() seems to hold the expiration date of the access token (the 60 minute one) and reverts to the date the profile was created when the 90 day one runs out. At least I think that is what is happening. I wish I had access to both dates but guess I don't and that's what I think was confirmed below.\n",
      "Does anybody else have a use case like this? It seems like it might not be so uncommon and can see the need for the 90 day token expiration date.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "In order to completely understand this you need to understand the difference between below settings and what these settings mean.\n",
      "Refresh token lifetime is by default 14 days, which means you can redeem the refresh token within 14 days of its issuance. When you redeem the Refresh token, a new Access, ID, and Refresh token pair is issued. The new refresh token is again valid for 14 days.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have Refresh token sliding window lifetime set to bounded and the Lifetime length is 90 days, users will be required to re-authenticate regardless of when the most recent Refresh token was issued.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have Refresh token sliding window lifetime set to no expiry, the Lifetime length will not be configurable any more. In this case, if the refresh token is redeemed within every 14 days (configured in Refresh token lifetime), users will never have to re-authenticate.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "If you don't want to force the users to reauthenticate after 90 days, you can either set Lifetime length to its maximum value of 365 days or set Refresh token sliding window lifetime to no expiry.\n",
      "You will not get any notification before expiry of the refresh token. However, you can check signInSessionsValidFromDateTime property via Graph API or refreshTokensValidFromDateTime via PowerShell to see when the refresh token was last issued to the user.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Comments:\n",
      "So I can either create code to re-authenticate and leave the settings as they are or set the \"Refresh token sliding window lifetime\" to \"No expiry\", correct? What if the user tries to access an API beyond the 14 days? Do I need them to re-authenticate anyway?\n",
      "Yes, that is correct. If the user tries to access an API beyond the 14 days, refresh token will be expired and interactive authentication will be required to acquire the new refresh token.\n",

      "\n",
      "Question:\n",
      "\n",
      "There is some confusion between two aspects of Azure IoT-Hub. I see here that Azure Digital Twins (with DTDL) simplify device state management (reported, desired properties) when compared to Azure IoT-Hub Device Twins. However, I see here that they appear to be separate but linkable entities.\n",
      "So the question: Can Azure Digital Twins (and DTDL) be seen/used as REPLACEMENTS for Azure IoT-Hub Device Twins. How? If not, why not, since having two separate Twins appears overly complex?\n",
      "Note that we use the IoT-Edge and leverage its offline features of reported and desired properties in the Iot-Hub Device Twins.\n",
      "Thanks!\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "Short answer: No\n",
      "Longer and arguably more friendly answer: To leverage the Device Twins in IoT Hub, you need Device Twins in IoT Hub, but you can link it to your Digital Twin in Azure Digital Twins (ADT). If you want to include your Device Twin properties in ADT, you need to route your Device Twin messages to a Function that will make the translation to ADT. In this subsection of the docs, you can see the differences in notation.\n",
      "If you want to let ADT 'drive' your Device Twin, you need to subscribe to ADT change notifications, consume them in another Function and apply the changes in the Device Twin in IoT Hub. This is currently all custom work, you can base some of the work on the link you provided in your question.\n",
      "With regards to your question about complexity: it might seem a little complex to set up ADT as your single source of configuration, but when it's done, you have your config in one place. In practice, I'm not seeing this happen a lot.\n",
      "Important to note\n",
      "To make things a little more confusing, the first link you provided mentioned Digital Twins and Device Twins as if they're two different things, while in fact, it's three. You have the Device Twin in IoT Hub, the Digital Twin in IoT Plug and Play context and a Digital Twin within Azure Digital Twins. It's important to understand the differences between the three, as ADT is a separate system, but PnP Digital Twins and Device Twins are accessible through your IoT Hub.\n",

In the end the issue was with launching the server with 'python manage.py runserver' which probably set's up django with the ip adress of the loopback (127.0.0.1) as a string instead of the hostname (localhost). Solution is to force Django to use localhost instead of 127.0.0.1 by invoking:  python manage.py runserver localhost:8080 \n",

      "Some context: Our current technology stack is integrated with the Graph SDK, and for our current use case, we are fine with the \"public preview\" status of this API endpoint, but it seems like the roll out of the preview is not yet complete. (We don't have a response yet from the form on that page). Integrating the C++/C# File SDK solutions, especially given that our initial experiments with the Java wrapper haven't been successful, would require a great deal of additional work.\n",

      "Above are the current integration options from this presentation.\n",
      "If we need to bulk assign sensitivity labels to 10 thousand documents, can we use the Microsoft Graph SDK for this or must we use the File SDK? Can this be done through service account connections (e.g. using a client_id and client_secret)? How efficiently can the File SDK assign sensitivity labels and are they any limitations here? What about when bulk assigning 10 million documents?\n",
      "EDIT 20/09/2022: In response to a question from below, we are trying to assign sensitivity labels to files that are located in Microsoft 365 Sharepoint and OneDrive. To date, in order to read and write other types of metadata, we have typically accessed these files through the Graph SDK and client secret credentials.\n",

      "\n",
      "Answers:\n",
      "\n",
      "MIP SDK isn't an ideal solution for files that are at rest in SharePoint or OneDrive if performance is a concern. Labeling the files requires fully downloading, applying the label, then replacing the file in the service. That adds latency both directions on the download and upload, as well as applying the protection.\n",
      "For files local on disk, I've written samples that can apply labels to hundreds of files per minute (varies based on files size and protection status). Unfortunately, the added overhead of extracting the file from ODSP, labeling, and putting it back will make that unachievable.\n",
      "Instead, you should look at these APIs: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/programatic-way-apply-sensitivity-label-file-sanjoyan-mustafi/\n",

      "Thanks. We will continue investigating the C# File SDK and the Sharepoint API (i.e. the LinkedIn blog post) options. But, the first might not meet our bulk requirements as you say, and the second might be too restrictive given the authorization credential flow requirements as outlined on the page as we need to bulk label across a tenant. The Graph API assignSensitivityLabel link you shared is the same I shared above, and this looks great. I will reach out to you off StackOverflow with a question about how to get this enabled for my tenant - we signed up last week & haven't received a response.\n",
